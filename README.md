# SJBRG

My [Ghost](https://ghost.org) theme for my personal blog [SJBRG.se](https://sjbrg.se). A minimalist, responsive, and open-source two-column theme based on [Crisp](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp) by [Kathy Qian](http://kathyqian.com). Last tested with Ghost v4.

### Changes compared to the Crisp theme

* Added support for featured image and caption
* Added support for custom excerpt
* Improved SEO with proper use of H-tags
* Removed duplicate Open Graph meta tags
* Changed styling of tags from buttons to hashtags
